- 👋 Hi, I’m @pkimmerling. I'm currently a 4th year Ph.D. student at Washington State University. Go Cougs!
- 👀 I’m interested in applying linear algebra and graph theory to solve problems, both concrete and abstract.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about how algebraic graph theory has applications in quantum computing and quantum information theory. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a machine learning or image/signal analysis project to bolster my resume.
- 📫 Message me if you want to discuss quantum computing or data analysis.
